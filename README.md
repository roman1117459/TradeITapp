<a href="#"><h3>##<b>Summary</b></h3></a> Of this app was built using the latest and greatest technologies out today. I choose to built it in <b>Django</b> because <b>instagram</b>,<b>reddit</b>,<b>youtube</b>,<b>dropbox</b>,<b>mozilla</b>, <b>pinterest</b> uses <i><b>Django</b></i> which is one kind of <b>blogging</b> and photo sharing app with impecceable load times. I <b>choose</b> to use <b>Reddit</b> as my single state handler because of its overall clean and <b>effective</b> way of handling the state of the application especially for scaling it larger. I chose Django because well, I love using it. It takes away the layer that other task runners like Gulp and Grunt and to projects. I didn't build out the server file till I needed to launch it on <b>Subdomain</b>. I went with <b>Django Development server</b>. I deployed it on subdomain for your viewing pleasure.

Also, use Blog as a verb, meaning to maintain or add content to a blog. The main aim of this project is to provide data to <b>students, engineer, doctors, businessperson, service holder or any unemployed person</b> has different specific site. The requirements gather process is intensify and focused specifically on <b>software</b>. To understand the nature of the programs to be build, the software engin must understand the information domain for the software, as well as required <b>function, behavior, performance, and interfacing</b>. <b>Requirements</b> for the both the system and the software are <b>documented and reviewed with the customer</b>.



<h3>###<b>Design‚≠ê</b></h3> I choose a familiar <b>design</b> to most. I went with this because I love the <b>simplicity</b> of it.
